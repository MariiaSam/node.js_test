      "description": "Representatives of this sign are natural leaders, but they are often impatient and overly hot-tempered. They are impulsive people. They have a strong and bossy personality, and they strive to be the first in everything. Aries throws themselves into battle selflessly, bravely, with a fervent belief that this is the only way everyone should act. They always want to succeed in everything, to be recognised, do not expect mercy from anyone and defend their interests. The disadvantages of Aries include straightforwardness, irritability and selfishness. Sometimes they can be idealistic and naive. Striving for authority and dominance, Aries can become aggressive due to his impulsiveness and inability to listen to advice. Aries will achieve a lot if he learns to think and analyse his actions.",
      "male": "Aries' strengths and weaknesses are often two extremes of the same character trait. For example, they often pursue a goal with enviable perseverance. But when things are clearly failing and leading to failure, he can be wildly stubborn and refuse to listen to anyone's advice, even the wisest.",
      "female": "Representatives of the sign of Aries are distinguished by their relaxation and self-confidence. They are sociable, witty and not lacking in beauty. They are skilful at keeping a conversation going and are always the centre of attention.      An Aries woman is quite independent and will not tolerate a man in the house just to be there. Such a woman leads an active lifestyle and loves sports. She is dynamic and loves competition. Between rock climbing and a carefree holiday on the beach, she will rather choose the former. She does not show tears, does not complain about her fate. She charges her loved ones with her endless energy." ,

      "description": "Taurus is one of the earthly signs of the zodiac, ruled by Venus, the planet of love, beauty and money. People born under this sign have a strong character and are ready to pursue their goals no matter what. Perseverance, resilience, incredible endurance, practicality and perseverance are some of their most striking character traits. But despite this, the direct influence of Venus makes itself felt, making Taurus creative and sensual natures.",
      "male": "Men born under this zodiac sign are calm, reliable, exude confidence and are always ready to take responsibility for their family and their beloved woman. But at the same time, they are quite secretive, keep everything to themselves and prefer not to burden others with personal problems. Taurus men are stable in relationships, do not like quarrels and value equality in a couple, and are always ready to create a favourable atmosphere at home. Taurus is a sign of loyalty and devotion.",
      "female": "Taurus women have a refined taste and sense of style. They are practical, but also very creative and always strive to create comfort around them. Representatives of this sign love to be the centre of attention and easily become the life of the party. Taurus women are romantic, gentle and wise, but can be quite bossy at times.",
